            <h4>2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
            <p>Upon interacting with the experience, I first paid attention to the bright yellow ball emojis ðŸŸ¡. 
                Coming in various sizes, the emojis floated in random places and around the window screen. 
                They moved in different speeds, although most of them were quite slow. 
                Some bounced off away from one another and some from the edges of the window screen. 
                Some went past each other, making it appear as if they were tangible objects trapped inside.</p>

            <h4>3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
            <p>In the experience, I spent the most time engaging with reading the bits of text and supporting images that appeared. 
                Each time I clicked on an emoji on the screen, the next part to the narrative would appear on the top left of the screen. 
                On the bottom of the website is a moving distortion of natural terrain in black and white.
                Its constant movements sometimes were in the way of the text, creating a sense of discomfort and loss of focus. 
                As a result, it affected my reading experience, extending my engagement.

            <h4>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
            <p>The most common action in my two minute interaction was clicking onto the yellow ball emojis.
                In order for the narrative to proceed, I needed to continue popping the emojis.

            <h4>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
            <p>The interactive experience consisted mainly of popping the yellow ball emojis, and text and pictures that followed. 
                Thus, my impression of the intended primary goal was story-telling in an interesting way.

            <h4>6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h4>
            <p>The experience communicated its primary goal, through the unique display of the narrative. 
                Progression of the narrative is interesting. 
                The text appears from the top, before gradually descending to the bottom, as more text on top appears. 
                This shows that the narrative moves in an ascending manner, reflecting the plot, where <div>"the wind reached my window on the 165th floor". </div></p>
            
                <img src="/images/165.png" width="600px">
            
                <p>Further, as the plot unfolds with more emojis being popped, the user can discover the relevancy and correlation of them in the story.
                After all, <div> "the yellow lines", "mustard silk gown" and "floating" </div></p>

            <h4>7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h4>
            <p>The intended length of a single interaction should take about 5 minutes. 
                In this duration, the user would mainly focus on popping the bright yellow ball emojis. 
                They would also engage in skimming through the narrative and supporting images.
                I think that the experience should be revisited several more times after the initial interaction. Perhaps, after a few days have passed.
                This way, with a fresh mind, they would be able to observe the minute details present in the experience.
                For example, the behaviour and movement of the emojis. 
                They would also be able to better comprehend the narrative and its relation to the emojis.
                Further, in the revisits, they would realise that not only does the order of the narrative change; there can be different pictures and events in the narrative.

            <h4>8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h4>
            <p>The mental model the experience refers to is the metaphor of time. 
                Time is spent on the interaction of popping the yellow emojis. 
                This produces random parts to a first-person narrative, which reflects one's complex feelings. 
                As the user takes time to read the narrative, it can be suggested that time has absorbed the feelings it has produced.
            </p>

        <section style="background-color:#b7ad99;" id="attributes" class="sections">
            <h4>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h4>
            <p>This suggests that I should feel more conscious of the relationship between time and feelings. 
                It reminds me of the saying, "time heals wounds", in relation to sorrow and other negative emotions.
                When engaging with the experience, I should pay more attention to the unique randomisation in the delivery of the plot. 
                I should also be aware of the changes in the imagery and events to the narrative.

            <h4>10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h4>
            <p>The most frustrating element of the interaction, while being unique, is the randomisation of the narrative. 
                After all, there can be various combinations for the parts of the narrative. 
                With each refresh of the website, there would be a slightly different narrative generated. 
                It is frustrating to not know the 'true' version of it.

            <h4>11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h4>
            <p>The most satisying element of the interaction is the yellow emojis that float across the screen. 
                The action of popping them gives a sense of therapy and relaxation. It is simple and stress-free.
